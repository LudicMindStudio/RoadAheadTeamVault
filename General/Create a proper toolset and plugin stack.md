We don't want to have plugin bloat. Ideally just a few engine and core features that make common development tasks easier.

Some features that need to be addressed:
- Auto word wrap for text boxes
- Copying events and events as referenced objects instead of copies
- Better audio controls then manual events
- Better controls/control mapping. Routing and movement restrictions included

Some libraries or plugins
- Window and popup creation
- Timed events and event triggering between events

yanfly has a full plugin stack. Don't need all of them but look at engine related parts:
